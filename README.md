# QUANTT-Derivatives-Pricing-2023-2024

Welcome to the official repository for the QUANTT 2023-2024 derivatives pricing team. This repository is a comprehensive collection of models, research findings, and insights developed by our team over the course of the year. Our goal is to provide a detailed overview of our approaches to derivatives pricing, the data sources we used, and the performance of our models.

## Overview

Our project aims to explore and develop traditional models for pricing derivatives. Through rigorous research and practical implementation, we strive to enhance the understanding and application of financial models in real-world scenarios.

## Models

### Black-Scholes-Merton

- **Description**: The Black-Scholes-Merton model is a cornerstone of modern financial theory, providing a mathematical framework for pricing European options. Our implementation...

### Monte-Carlo

- **Description**: The Monte-Carlo simulation model leverages random sampling and statistical modelling to estimate mathematical functions and mimic the operations of complex systems. Our application...

### Hybrid Model

- **Description**: Our third model is a novel approach that synergizes the Black-Scholes-Merton and Monte-Carlo models. This hybrid model aims to enhance the accuracy of volatility and option pricing by...

## Data Sources

Initially, Yahoo Finance was our primary data source. However, after identifying discrepancies with real-time market data, we transitioned to exclusively using data from Interactive Broker's API. This decision was driven by our commitment to precision, acknowledging that even minimal inaccuracies can significantly impact model performance.

## Research

Our research concentrated on several key areas, including, but not limited to, the effectiveness of traditional models in modern markets, the integration of mathematic-intensive approaches, and the impact of market volatility on option pricing. Through this research...

## Performance/Accuracy

- **Black-Scholes-Merton**: Our implementation of the Black-Scholes-Merton model demonstrated high accuracy in...
- **Monte-Carlo Simulation**: The Monte-Carlo model proved to be exceptionally versatile in...
- **Hybrid Model**: The hybrid model showed promising results in...

## Acknowledgements

We sincerely thank the QUANTT 2023-2024 executive team for their unwavering support, leadership, and organization. Their initiative to introduce the derivatives pricing team this year has been instrumental in providing us with invaluable learning opportunities. Here's hoping that next year will be an even greater success for the club!

We want to acknowledge Interactive Brokers as our intermediary in obtaining high-quality CBOE market data, which was essential for the accuracy of our models.

We look forward to continuing our journey in the field of quantitative finance!
